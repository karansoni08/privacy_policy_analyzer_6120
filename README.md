The Privacy Policy Analyzer is a Chrome extension that uses AI to analyze and evaluate the privacy policies of websites. It provides insights into the data collection and usage practices of websites, helping users make informed decisions about their online privacy. The extension communicates with a backend server powered by Flask and leverages a language model for analysis.

Analyze Privacy Policies: Extracts and evaluates the text of website privacy policies.
Ratings and Explanations: Provides structured ratings (out of 5) for parameters like data collection, data privacy, and data sharing.
Star Rating Visualization: Displays an overall rating in the form of stars, including support for half-stars.
Interactive Buttons: Allows users to proceed to the website or navigate to the Google homepage directly from the extension.
Table Format Display: Presents detailed analysis results in a clear, tabular format.
